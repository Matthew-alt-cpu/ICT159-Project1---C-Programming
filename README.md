**Algorithm Test Summary**

Overall, the Algorithm performed well with the test samples used. There were a few changes that the early test allowed for me to quickly retcon, the most notable change was to the entire equation of each function of the Algorithm. When testing for multiple outputs of a specific variable I quickly noticed that there was no way to get a multiple of any of the amounts with the equation I had, this led to creating variables that can hold the amount the currency could be input into the users input, than it could be multiplied by the original amount to then minus off the input number, giving a new figure for the functions to work off.
